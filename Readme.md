# Twitter Clone
Cloning a well-known social media site like Twitter is a challenging and exciting project that can help you gain valuable experience in web development, database management, and user interface design. The aim of this project is to create a functional and scalable clone of Twitter that replicates its key features, such as creating user accounts, posting tweets, following other users, and displaying user profiles.
